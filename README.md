# Notification Microservice
This microservice is a part of 'Airline Management Backend' system, for more info refer to the main repository. This microservice handles the mailing service required for ticket booking. In this repository we have used GMAIL's SMTP server to set up the mailing service, and have used node-cron to handle the cron jobs for reminder service. Along with this we have used a Notification-Ticket model which stores the data of the recipients who we will send the notification through the mail. Later we will also integerate the reminder service through mobile SMS as well
